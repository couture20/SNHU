## Welcome to Ryan Couture's ePortfolio

The purpose of this page is to summarize and briefly showcase my abilities as a programmer. Below you'll see examples of past and ongoing projects that I have done over the past few years. They're examples of projects that completed for my current job, of applications done while in college, along with projects that I do in my spare time at home. 

For the past few years I have been expanding my knowledge of programming, through college work, my current job at Ups and through home projects such as NFTs. 

Currently I work at Ups as the Central Zone I.E. Service Engineer. My current duties are but not limited to:
- Data mining via either code that I have written or through advance interactions with Oracle and Power Bi. I am very fluent in SQL programming, and can generate quries through numerous different interfaces. 
- I create custom reports for Corporate management, that often require coding in VBA that interact with either hardlined or cloud computing databases.
- Evaluate new technologies to be implemented within the zone. Whether it's new automation systems or new applications, I evaluate if it can enhance the current systems and what the potential ROI would be on the new system or application.
- Because of my interactions with emerging automation systems, I am able to implement and troubleshoot XLE and PLC systems.
- Through these various aspects of my job, I frequently work within a team or lead a team depending on the project. 
- I train and develop operations managment teams and other company employees on how to effectively use newly implememted systems.
- Ovrall my role is to monitor and enhance the zones logisitc capabilities and to ensure a more profitable and quick return on investments. 

In my personal life I have found in interest in blockchaining, in particular with NFTs. I have made several basic websites that utilize personalized code to allow the website's visitors to mint NFTs that I created and send it to their digital wallet. I have written code that will generate thousands of various NFTs based on the users layer inputs, and will attach the metadata to each NFT. Below is a link to a NFT minting app that I created, along with the artwork that was generated through the art generating program.
